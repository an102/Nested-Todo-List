# Nested-Todo-List
A nested todo list that allows endless sublists

Press the blue "+" button to begin adding list items. If nothing is typed, or if ESC is pushed, the item will disappear. To add sublist items, press the "+" button below the item for which you would like to create a new sublist.

Items may be deleted individually by pressing the red "x" buttons. This will also delete any descendant list items. To delete completed items, press the "Delete Completed Todos" button.

Items may be marked as complete by checking their checkboxes, or alternatively, the "Toggle All" box may be checked to mark all items as complete. If an item is checked, any descendant list items will also be checked.
